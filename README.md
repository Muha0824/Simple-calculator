Since my last projects which was about guessing the number (link : https://github.com/Muha0824/Guess-The-Number ) . I had to learn whole new stuff which took me some time to learn, but now I feel a little more confident so its back to makeing these projects. 

I am following the video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw), and I am half way through. 

So, I hope I make some cool projects from now on, which is a little more practical.
